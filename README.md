# Guess-MY-Number-GAME

## Description 

In this number guessing game, the goal is to correctly guess the number between **0 and 20**. 

The game provides **hints** after each incorrect guess to help the user get closer to the correct answer. 

The user's **Highscore**, which is set to 20 at the beginning of the game, decreases by 1 each time the user makes an incorrect guess. 

This serves as a way for the game to track the user's progress and provides an incentive for the user to make fewer incorrect guesses.

The user can submit their answer by pressing the Enter key on their keyboard, which makes it easy for them to submit their guess. The increment and decrement buttons allow the user to adjust their guess without having to enter a new value each time. 

This makes the process of guessing more efficient and allows the user to quickly test different values without having to manually enter each one.

Overall, the number guessing game is a simple yet challenging game that tests the user's ability to guess the correct number. The game's design, with the Highscore tracker, hint system, and increment/decrement buttons, make it a fun and engaging experience for users of all ages.
